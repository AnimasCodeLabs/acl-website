      <h3>Case Study</h3>
      <h4>BizLink Colorado</h4>

      <p>Animas Code Labs had 6 weeks to build a working application that made
        the 1.6 milion business listings from the Colorado Secretary of State
        useful to the general public. In the 8 days before the Go Code Finals,
        we got 42 business owners to claim their companies and start using the
        product. Based on our users' feedback, we were able to learn how they
        interact with the site, and make several adjustments to improve the user
        experience.</p>
